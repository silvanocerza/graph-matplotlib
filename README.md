## What is this

This a personal attempt of reimplement [`dagrejs`](https://github.com/dagrejs) in Python for Matplotlib.

The `dagrejs` library is, or was, the backbone of [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid).

Most people that want to draw graphs in Python will use graphviz, with all the problems this entails. Matplotlib is a good alternative if you don't need to do anything too complex. Though using boxes that contain text as your nodes makes it much more difficult already.

I consider Mermaid one of the best graph libraries, so I decided to reimplement at least the part of it that makes it possible to create nice looking flowcharts.

This obviously doesn't work yet, maybe it won't ever work. Who knows. ðŸ¤·
